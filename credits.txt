Other mentions:
Iriy "BUzer" Sitnikov for Paranoia's source code and several
instances of him helping me become a better coder. I relied on
how Paranoia rendered the world to write my own, watered-down
world renderer for what was back then Raven City.
Some very small pieces might still exist inside Pathos, but
the code is very different now. Still, what BUzer did with
Paranoia was an amazing feat, so I feel I have to thank him
for a lot.
Uncle Misha for the idea and solution to normalizing vertex
weights upon loading them. FiElectro for one of the fence
textures used in the WAD files.

Twinkie Masta:
I requested permission to use Twinkie Masta's Glock model as a
placeholder model  on Gamebanana(then FPSBanana) back in the 
early 2010s. I doubt they still remember this, but I am going
to stick with using it here. It shouldn't be a problem.
Update: This was later replaced with an original model I got
made by BrussTrigger.
