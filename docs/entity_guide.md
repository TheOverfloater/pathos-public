# Entity Guide

# Description
This guide features a comprehensive guide to all the entities you can find in Pathos.
Thanks to TWHL for their entity guide, which I referenced while writing this document.

# Shared keyvalues
Some entities share keyvalues that will be noted down here instead of featuring them multiple times in the
document:

## Render Mode
>Sets the render mode of the entity. Pathos supports both lit and unlit(legacy) transparent entities. The
>console variable r_legacytransparents enables or disables whether rendering is done using "legacy"
>fullbright transparent entities, or all transparent entities will have lightmapping applied to them.
 - Values:
   - "Normal": Normal, completely opaque entity.
   - "Color": Transparency with a color applied.
   - "Texture": Transparency with just the texture applied.
   - "Glow": Modulate sprite size and brightness based on distance to the viewer. Only usable by sprite 
   entities.
   - "Solid": Legacy/unused, was used in Half-Life for alpha tested textures.
   - "Additive": Brightness is determined by the texture color component's brightness, where black is 
   completely transparent, and white is completely opaque.
   - "Lit Color": If legacy transparency is set, this will be the same as "Color" but with lighting 
   and textures applied.
   - "Lit Texture": If legacy transparency is set, this will be the same as "Texture" but with 
   lighting applied.
   - "Lit Additive": If legacy transparency is set, this will be the same as "Additive" but with 
   lighting applied. The lighting will also affect transparency of the surfaces.
   - "Unlit Solid": Alpha tested surfaces but without lightmapping.   

## Render FX
>Can be used to set a special render effect on the entity, most of which affect the transparency of the
>entity in question. You need to set the render mode of the entity to "Texture" or "Additive" for this to
>have any effect.
 - Values:
    - "Normal": No render effect.
    - "Slow Pulse:" The transparency of the entity will be modulated as a slow pulse.
    - "Fast Pulse:" The transparency of the entity will be modulated as a fast pulse.
    - "Slow Wide Pulse": The transparency of the entity will be modulated as a slow pulse with a wider 
	alpha value range.

	alpha value range.
	- "Slow Strobe": A slow strobe effect is applied to the transparency.
	- "Fast Strobe": A fast strobe effect is applied to the transparency.
	- "Faster Strobe": A much faster strobe effect is applied to the transparency.
	- "Slow Flicker": The entity's transparency will slowly flicker.

	- "Slow Fade Away": Entity slowly fades out.
	- "Fast Fade Away": Entity fades out fast.
	- "Slow Become Solid": Turn from completely transparent to fully opaque slowly.
	- "Fast Become Solid": Turn from completely transparent to fully opaque rapidly.

	- "Hologram (Distort + fade)": Same as the hologram effect used in Half-Life's training levels.

	env_sprite or env_glow to perform tracelines against brushmodels also for glow occlusion tests.
	- "Skybox Object": Only useful for VBM models and brushmodels. Will set the entity to be visible in a 
	skybox. The entity will be only visible in the skybox, and is not rendered for the main renderpass.
	- "Skybox Object - In Z": Only useful for VBM models and brushmodels. Will set the entity to be visible 
	in a skybox, but will not have it's contributions to the depth buffer cleared after the skybox rendering 
	is done, and will occlude fragments blocked by it's geometry.
	- "Scaled Skybox VBM model": Only useful for VBM models. Will set the entity to be visible in a skybox, 
	and will also have the "Scale" value applied.
	- "Glow Aura": The entity will form a glow aura around it much like usable objects and items do. The 
	color of the aura can be overriden using the "Render Color" keyvalue.
	- "Mirror Only": The entity will only be rendered in a mirror and not be visible to the player otherwise.
	- "Monitor Only": The entity will only be rendered in a monitor, and not be visible to the player 
	outside of the monitor entity.
	- "Angular Sprite": If set, the env_sprite's angles will be used as a forward angle to calculate how 
	much it shines based on what angle the player is looking at it from.
	- "In Portal Entity": Marks the entity to be rendered for func_portal_surface entities. The entity 
	will not be visible in the main renderpass.
	- "Scaled VBM model": "Scale" is applied to this VBM model, allowing you to scale the model used.
	- "Scaled VBM model In Portal": Same as "In Portal Entity" and "Scaled VBM model" but combined.
	- "No VIS checks": The entity will have no VIS checks done for it, meaning it will be visible across 
	all the level.
	
## Light style/Appearance
>This is the same as it was in Half-Life, except in Pathos you need to use dynamic lights to have switchable
>and/or animated lighting in your level. Pathos does not support HLRAD-based switchable lighting due to

# trigger_cameramodel
>This entity acts as a script entity for first-person cutscenes. It uses an animated model to take control
